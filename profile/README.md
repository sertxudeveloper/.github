We create web applications and open source packages mainly in the Laravel ecosystem.
We sometimes write [tutorials](https://sertxu.dev/blog) too!

### Our Open Source contribution

We love Laravel and whether we can contribute to the Laravel ecosystem.

Here are some of our open-source packages:

- [laravel-translatable](https://github.com/sertxudeveloper/laravel-translatable): Adds multilanguage support for your app and translate your Laravel models.
- [laravel-media-model](https://github.com/sertxudeveloper/laravel-media-model): Attach media files to your Laravel models and create media collections.
- [livewire-combobox](https://github.com/sertxudeveloper/livewire-combobox): A searchable combobox for your Livewire forms.
- [laravel-lockscreen](https://github.com/sertxudeveloper/laravel-lockscreen): Adds a lock screen to your Laravel app to keep your users secured.
- [laravel-pagination](https://github.com/sertxudeveloper/laravel-pagination): An opinionated custom Laravel pagination.
- [laravel-counters](https://github.com/sertxudeveloper/laravel-counters): Manage counters with year and series in your Laravel app.

We also developed some more, but these are no longer maintained:

- [laravel-sitemap](https://github.com/sertxudeveloper/laravel-sitemap): Create a sitemap from your Laravel app.

### Our commercial products

We have some commercial products that help us continue to maintain our open-source packages:

- [Cuelist](https://cuelist.app): Helps you coordinate your team in a live show.

You can help with our open source efforts in many ways: by resolving open issues or just by sharing our packages and products with your friends or colleges.

You can also sponsor our open source work via [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/sertxudev).
