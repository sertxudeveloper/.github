# Contributing

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! ❤️

Contributions are **welcome** and will be fully **credited**.

Please read and understand the contribution guide before creating an issue or pull request.
It will make it a lot easier for us maintainers and smooth out the experience for all involved.

The community looks forward to your contributions. 🎉

## Code of Conduct

Everyone participating in any of our projects is governed by our
[Code of Conduct](https://github.com/sertxudeveloper/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## Viability

When requesting or submitting new features, first consider whether they might be useful to others. Open source projects are used by many developers, who may have entirely different needs than your own. Think about whether or not your feature is likely to be used by other users of the project.

## Procedure
Before filing an issue:

- Attempt to replicate the problem, to ensure that it wasn't a coincidental incident.
- Check to make sure your feature suggestion isn't already present within the project.
- Check the pull requests tab to ensure that the bug doesn't have a fix in progress.
- Check the pull requests tab to ensure that the feature isn't already in progress.

Before submitting a pull request:

- Check the codebase to ensure that your feature doesn't already exist.
- Check the pull requests to ensure that another person hasn't already submitted the feature or fix.


## Reporting Bugs

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect information, and describe the issue in detail in your report. Please complete the following steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible.

> **Warning**<br>
> You must never report security-related issues, vulnerabilities, or bugs including sensitive information to the issue tracker, or elsewhere in public. Instead sensitive bugs must be sent by email to support@sertxudeveloper.com.

## Suggesting Features

When requesting or submitting new features, first consider whether they might be useful to others. Open source projects are used by many developers, who may have entirely different needs than your own. Think about whether or not your feature is likely to be used by other users of the project.

> **Note**<br>
> If you don't know if it might be useful to others, you can open an Issue to discuss it, if it is finally not worth you will be saved a lot of time!
